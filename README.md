# readme-generator

## Description
         
The purpose of this project was to create a CLI application to generate professional README files quickly. Upon running the application you will be prompted for different inputs for each piece of the README. Once completed, the application automatically takes your data and organizes it in markdown. This file is then saved as ```README.md```. You know it works, because this README was generated with it! :)

## Usage
 Upon downloading, run ```npm i inquirer@8.2.4``` to install all necessary node modules.
